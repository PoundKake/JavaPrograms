Set up Instructions:
--------------------
** Make sure Java is installed on your computer **
** Make sure all of the files are in the same folder.  "PongGameProg" is probably a  good folder name. **

1) Run "playgame.sh" 
    - If having trouble running, open terminal and type "chmod +x playgame.sh"
    - What you did was change the permissions of the ".sh" file to  executable. 
    - Now run "playgame.sh" 

2) Enjoy game!
